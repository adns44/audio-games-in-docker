# audio-games-in-docker

Run your favourite audio game servers in Docker!

## What is an audiogame?
Audio games especialy made for blind users, to play FPS, car race, competitive and other type of games.

Most of these can run only on Windows, both of the client and server. Some game servers (E.G. Audio Quake, The Road Torage II) not interactive, so we can run in headlessly. Usualy it made for Windows but most of these can be run on Linux in a Docker container.

This repo contains configuration files to build the containers. To avoid conflicts with original game developers and licences, you can find only the configuration files but the binaries, game files not provided, you most download it for your own.
